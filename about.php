                <h2>About the Founder</h2>
                <h3>Cameron New</h3>
                <p><strong>Cameron New</strong> is a paramedic who has responded to countless emergencies across Aotearoa. Time and again, Cameron witnessed how outdoor hazards—slippery paths, poor lighting, hidden house numbers—contributed to preventable injuries and delayed emergency care.</p>
                <p>Motivated by these experiences, Cameron founded <strong>Safe Steps Aotearoa</strong> to address the gap between health needs and practical home safety support.</p>
                <p>As a first responder, Cameron saw firsthand that many emergency situations could have been prevented with simple, practical home safety improvements. This insight drove the creation of a charity that bridges the gap between recognizing safety needs and actually addressing them in the community.</p>

                    <h3>🧑‍⚕️ A Paramedic's Perspective</h3>
                    <p>Years of responding to emergencies revealed a clear pattern: many calls were related to falls and accidents that could have been prevented with better outdoor home safety.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">From slippery steps to poorly lit pathways, Cameron recognized that these were not just accidents—they were preventable incidents affecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p>
