# 🏠 Safe Steps Aotearoa

> *Small steps. Big difference.*

**Safe Steps Aotearoa** is a community-led charity dedicated to improving home safety and accessibility for vulnerable people across Aotearoa New Zealand. We reduce preventable hazards, improve emergency access, and support independent living for those who need it most.

## 🌟 The Problem

Every day across Aotearoa, people are injured not because of what happens inside their homes, but because of what happens on the way to the front door.

- **Slippery steps** covered in moss and mould
- **Poor outdoor lighting** leading to falls at night
- **Overgrown pathways** blocking safe access
- **Missing house numbers** delaying emergency responders
- **Cluttered entrances** creating trip hazards

For many—especially older adults, disabled individuals, and those facing financial hardship—these hazards are simply too difficult to fix alone. Some feel embarrassed to ask for help. Others don't know where to turn.

These small issues create big risks: **falls, injuries, delayed emergency care, and loss of independence.**
