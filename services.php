                <h3>Home Safety Assessments</h3>
                <p><strong>Free, friendly assessments</strong> identifying outdoor hazards around your home. Our trained volunteers will visit your property and create a simple, clear action plan with your input.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">We look for trip hazards, slippery surfaces, lighting issues, and other safety concerns that could lead to falls or injuries.</p>

                <h3>Pathway & Access Improvements</h3>
                <p>Clearing overgrown vegetation, debris, and trip hazards from pathways, driveways, and entrances. We ensure safe, clear access to and from your home.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This includes removing obstacles, trimming overhanging branches, and clearing leaves and debris that create slip hazards.</p>

                <h3>Slippery Surface Treatment</h3>
                <p>Pressure washing and anti-slip solutions for decks, steps, and pathways. We make slippery surfaces safe to walk on, especially when wet.</p>

                <h3>Lighting & Visibility</h3>
                <p>Installing and improving outdoor lighting for safety. Better lighting reduces the risk of falls at night and helps emergency services locate your home quickly.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">We can replace bulbs, install new lighting fixtures, or recommend lighting solutions that improve visibility without increasing energy costs.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">We use reflective materials that are visible both during the day and at night, making your home easy to locate.</p>
